            <hr className="solid_about" />

            <p className="p-5">‘National Institute of Textile Engineering and Research (NITER)’ was previously evolved from ‘Textile Industry Development Center (TIDC)’ which was established in January 1979 and once emerged as the only training centre capable of imparting practical oriented quality training for professionals engaged in the textile manufacturing industry. The main objective was to provide skilled professional manpower for the government-owned textile industries. Later on, from 1994 to 2007 this organization was known as ‘National Institute of Textile Training Research and Design (NITTRAD)’ and was operating need-based short courses related to textiles. In order to meet the upward demand of skilled textile engineers for the textiles and allied sector of Bangladesh, the objective was changed. In this continuance, the operational management of the institute was handed over to Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA) on September 2008. Since that time, it has been successfully running as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) organization and contributing to meet the acute demand of skilled professionals for our textile and allied sectors.</p>
